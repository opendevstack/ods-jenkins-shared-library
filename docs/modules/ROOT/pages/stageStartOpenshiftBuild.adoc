stageStartOpenshiftBuild triggers the BuildConfig related to the repository
being built.

stageStartOpenshiftBuild takes two optional params
(a) the first one, named "buildArgs", which is a map allowing to customise the image build step in OpenShift.
For example:
stageStartOpenshiftBuild(context, ["myArg":"val"])

(b) the second one, named "imageLabels", which is a map allowing to customise the image label generation.
For example:
stageStartOpenshiftBuild(context, [ : ], ["myImageLabel":"valLabel"]). This will end up as label prefixed with 'ext.'
