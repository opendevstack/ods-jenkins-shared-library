Triggers (and follows) a rollout of the `DeploymentConfig` related to the repository
being built.

It achieves this by tagging the image built in `odsComponentStageBuildOpenShiftImage` with `latest`. This might already trigger a rollout based on an existing `ImageTrigger`. If none is set, the stage will start a manual rollout.

If the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists, the templates in there will be applied using https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor]. In this case, it is recommended to remove any image triggers to avoid duplicate rollouts (one when configuration changes due to a config trigger and one when the image is tagged to `latest`). In addition to the configuration options below, one can use e.g. a `Tailorfile` to adjust the behaviour of Tailor as needed.
