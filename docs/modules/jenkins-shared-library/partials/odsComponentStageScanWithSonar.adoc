The "SonarQube Analysis" stage scans your source code and reports findings to
SonarQube. The configuration of the scan happens via the
`sonar-project.properties` file in the repository being built.

If your SonarQube server edition allows to scan multiple branches (any
commercial edition does), then this stage will automatically decorate pull
requests in Bitbucket with feedback from SonarQube (if the PR already exists
at the time of the Jenkins pipeline run).

In debug mode, the `sonar-scanner` binary is started with the `-X` flag.

If no `sonar.projectVersion` is specified in `sonar-project.properties`, it is
set to the shortened Git SHA.

== Options

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description


| *analyzePullRequests* +
_boolean_
|Whether to analyze pull requests and decorate them in Bitbucket. Turned
 on by default, however a scan is only performed if the `branch` property
 allows it.


| *branch* +
_String_
|Branch to scan.
 Example: `'master'`.
 Next to exact matches, it also supports prefixes (e.g. `feature/`) and all branches (`*`).


| *branches* +
_List<String>_
|Branches to scan.
 Example: `['master', 'develop']`.
 Next to exact matches, it also supports prefixes (e.g. `feature/`) and \
 all branches (`*`).
 Defaults to `master` for the community edition of SonarQube, and `*` for
 all other editions (which are capable of handling multiple branches).


| *longLivedBranches* +
_List<String>_
|Branch(es) for which no PR analysis should be performed. If not set, it
 will be extracted from  `branchToEnvironmentMapping` of the `context`.


| *odsNamespace* +
_Map<String,&nbsp;String>_
|Patterns to exclude from SonarQube scan.


| *requireQualityGatePass* +
_boolean_
|Whether to fail the build if the quality gate defined in the SonarQube
 project is not reached. Defaults to `false`.


| *resourceName* +
_String_
|Name of `BuildConfig`/`ImageStream` of the image that we want to scan (defaults to `context.componentId`).
 BuildOpenShiftImageStage puts the imageRef into a map with the `resourceName` as key.
 In order to be able to receive the imageRef for scanning, the `resourceName` needs
 to be the same as in BuildOpenShiftImageStage.


| *sonarQubeNexusRepository* +
_String_
|Nexus repository to upload the SonarQube report to.
 Automaticaly set by sonarqube configMap if present.
