Triggers (and follows) a rollout of the `DeploymentConfig` related to the repository
being built.

It achieves this by tagging the image built in `odsComponentStageBuildOpenShiftImage` with `latest`. This might already trigger a rollout based on an existing `ImageTrigger`. If none is set, the stage will start a manual rollout.

If the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists, the templates in there will be applied using https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor]. In this case, it is recommended to remove any image triggers to avoid duplicate rollouts (one when configuration changes due to a config trigger and one when the image is tagged to `latest`). In addition to the configuration options below, one can use e.g. a `Tailorfile` to adjust the behaviour of Tailor as needed.

Available options:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| selector
| Selector scope used to determine which resources are part of a component (defaults to `context.selector`).

| imageTag
| Image tag on which to apply the `latest` tag (defaults to `context.shortGitCommit`).

| deployTimeoutMinutes
| Adjust timeout of rollout (defaults to 5 minutes). Caution: This needs to be aligned with the deployment strategy timeout (timeoutSeconds) and the readiness probe timeouts (initialDelaySeconds + failureThreshold * periodSeconds).

| deployTimeoutRetries
| Adjust retries to wait for the pod during a rollout (defaults to 5). 

| chartDir
| Directory of Helm chart (defaults to `chart`).

| helmReleaseName
| Name of the Helm release (defaults to `context.componentId`). Change this value if you want to install separate instances of the Helm chart in the same namespace. In that case, make sure to use `{{ .Release.Name }}` in resource names to avoid conflicts.  Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmValues
| Map of key/value pairs to pass as values (by default, the key `imageTag` is set to the config option `imageTag`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmValuesFiles
| List of paths to values files (empty by default). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmDefaultFlags
| List of default flags to be passed verbatim to to `helm upgrade` (defaults to `['--install', '--atomic']`). Typically these should not be modified - if you want to pass more flags, use `helmAdditionalFlags` instead. Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmAdditionalFlags
| List of additional flags to be passed verbatim to to `helm upgrade` (empty by default). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmDiff
| Whether to show diff explaining changes to the release before running `helm upgrade` (`true` by default). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| helmPrivateKeyCredentialsId
| Credentials name of the private key used by helm-secrets (defaults to `<PROJECT>-cd-helm-private-key`). The fingerprint must match the one specified in `.sops.yaml`. Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.

| openshiftDir
| Directory with OpenShift templates (defaults to `openshift`).

| tailorPrivateKeyCredentialsId
| Credentials name of the private key used by Tailor (defaults to `<PROJECT>-cd-tailor-private-key`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorSelector
| Selector scope used by Tailor (defaults to config option `selector`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorVerify
| Whether Tailor verifies the live configuration against the desired state after application (defaults to `false`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorExclude
| Resource kind exclusion used by Tailor (defaults to `bc,is`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorParamFile
| Path to Tailor parameter file (defaults to none). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorPreserve
| Paths to preserve in the live configuration (defaults to `[]`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.

| tailorParams
| Additional parameters to pass to Tailor (defaults to `[]`). Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.
