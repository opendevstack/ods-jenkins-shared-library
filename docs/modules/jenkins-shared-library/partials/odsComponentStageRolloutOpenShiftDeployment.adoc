Triggers (and follows) a rollout of the `DeploymentConfig` related to the repository
being built.

It achieves this by tagging the image built in `odsComponentStageBuildOpenShiftImage` with `latest`. This might already trigger a rollout based on an existing `ImageTrigger`. If none is set, the stage will start a manual rollout.

If the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists, the templates in there will be applied using https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor]. In this case, it is recommended to remove any image triggers to avoid duplicate rollouts (one when configuration changes due to a config trigger and one when the image is tagged to `latest`). In addition to the configuration options below, one can use e.g. a `Tailorfile` to adjust the behaviour of Tailor as needed.

== Options

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description


| *branch* +
_String_
|Branch to run stage for.
 Example: `'master'`.
 Next to exact matches, it also supports prefixes (e.g. `feature/`) and all branches (`*`).


| *branches* +
_List<String>_
|Branches to run stage for.
 Example: `['master', 'develop']`.
 Next to exact matches, it also supports prefixes (e.g. `feature/`) and all branches (`*`).


| *chartDir* +
_String_
|Directory of Helm chart (defaults to `chart`).


| *deployTimeoutMinutes* +
_Integer_
|Adjust timeout of rollout (defaults to 5 minutes). Caution: This needs to
 be aligned with the deployment strategy timeout (timeoutSeconds) and the
 readiness probe timeouts (initialDelaySeconds + failureThreshold * periodSeconds).


| *deployTimeoutRetries* +
_Integer_
|Adjust retries to wait for the pod during a rollout (defaults to 5).


| *helmAdditionalFlags* +
_List<String>_
|List of additional flags to be passed verbatim to to `helm upgrade`
(empty by default). Only relevant if the directory referenced by
`chartDir` exists.


| *helmDefaultFlags* +
_List<String>_
|List of default flags to be passed verbatim to to `helm upgrade`
 (defaults to `['--install', '--atomic']`). Typically these should not be
 modified - if you want to pass more flags, use `helmAdditionalFlags`
 instead. Only relevant if the directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.


| *helmDiff* +
_boolean_
|Whether to show diff explaining changes to the release before running
 `helm upgrade` (`true` by default). Only relevant if the directory
 referenced by `chartDir` exists.


| *helmPrivateKeyCredentialsId* +
_String_
|Credentials name of the private key used by helm-secrets (defaults to
 `${context.cdProject}-helm-private-key`). The fingerprint must match the
 one specified in `.sops.yaml`. Only relevant if the directory referenced
 by `chartDir` exists.


| *helmReleaseName* +
_String_
|Name of the Helm release (defaults to `context.componentId`). Change this
 value if you want to install separate instances of the Helm chart in the
 same namespace. In that case, make sure to use `{{ .Release.Name }}` in
 resource names to avoid conflicts.  Only relevant if the directory
 referenced by `chartDir` exists.


| *helmValues* +
_Map<String,&nbsp;String>_
|Key/value pairs to pass as values (by default, the key `imageTag` is set
 to the config option `imageTag`). Only relevant if the directory
 referenced by `chartDir` exists.


| *helmValuesFiles* +
_List<String>_
|List of paths to values files (empty by default). Only relevant if the
 directory referenced by `chartDir` exists.


| *imageTag* +
_String_
|Image tag on which to apply the `latest` tag (defaults to `context.shortGitCommit`).


| *openshiftDir* +
_String_
|Directory with OpenShift templates (defaults to `openshift`).


| *selector* +
_String_
|Selector scope used to determine which resources are part of a component
 (defaults to `context.selector`).


| *tailorExclude* +
_String_
|Resource kind exclusion used by Tailor (defaults to `bc,is`). Only
 relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorParamFile* +
_String_
|Path to Tailor parameter file (defaults to none). Only relevant if the
 directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorParams* +
_List<String>_
|Additional parameters to pass to Tailor (defaults to `[]`). Only
 relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorPreserve* +
_List<String>_
|Paths to preserve in the live configuration (defaults to `[]`). Only
 relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorPrivateKeyCredentialsId* +
_String_
|Credentials name of the private key used by Tailor (defaults to
 `${context.cdProject}-tailor-private-key`). Only relevant if the
 directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorSelector* +
_String_
|Selector scope used by Tailor (defaults to config option `selector`).
 Only relevant if the directory referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.


| *tailorVerify* +
_boolean_
|Whether Tailor verifies the live configuration against the desired state
 after application (defaults to `false`). Only relevant if the directory
 referenced by `openshiftDir` exists.
