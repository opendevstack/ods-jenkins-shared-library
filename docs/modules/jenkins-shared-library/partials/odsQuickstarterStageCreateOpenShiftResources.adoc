Uses a set of OpenShift templates to create resources in OpenShift. The resources are created both in `*-dev` and `*-test` namespace. https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor[Tailor] is used to apply the templates, and fed with a parameter file if it exists.

Available options:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| directory
| Directory in which templates are located, defaults to `${context.sourceDir}/openshift`.

| envFile
| Parameter file to use, defaults to `${context.sourceDir}/ocp.env`

| selector
| Label selector to constrain `tailor apply` to, defaults to `app=${context.projectId}-${context.componentId}`.
|===

All the created OpenShift resources are automatically labeled to ease their management.

The quickstarter pipeline does a best effort to assign appropriate labels for a new component,
based on the information of the quickstarter. This information can be customised by updating the component metadata.

Detailed information about the labelling can be found xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[here].
