The "Trivy Security Scan" stage scans the filesystem of the cloned repository using https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[Trivy] and generates a https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/sbom[SBOM] report, with https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/[CycloneDX] format by default. Check Trivy supported formats https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/supply-chain/sbom/[here].

As a result, a Bitbucket Code Insight entry is added to the git commit (in Bitbucket) that basically
contains a link to the scan report stored in Nexus. The Bitbucket Code Insight entry can be seen in a pull request.
The pull request in Bitbucket shows the Code Insight of the latest commit of the PR.

To get started, edit your `Jenkinsfile` and add the Trivy stage:
