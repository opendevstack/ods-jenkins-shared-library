The "SonarQube Analysis" stage scans your source code and reports findings to
SonarQube. The configuration of the scan happens via the
`sonar-project.properties` file in the repository being built.

In debug mode, the `sonar-scanner` binary is started with the `-X` flag.

If no `sonar.projectVersion` is specified in `sonar-project.properties`, it is
set to the shortened Git SHA.

Available options:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Option | Description

| branch
| Branch(es) to scan. This can be a comma separated list. Next to exact matches, it also supports prefixes (e.g. `feature/`) and all branches (`*`).

| requireQualityGatePass
| Whether to fail the build if the quality gate defined in the SonarQube project is not reached. Defaults to `false`.

| analyzePullRequests
| Whether to analyze pull requests and decorate them in Bitbucket. Turned on by default, however a scan is only performed if the `branch` property allows it.

| longLivedBranches
| Branch(es) for which no PR analysis should be performed. If not set, it will be extracted from  `branchToEnvironmentMapping` of the `context`.
