= Jenkins Shared Library

OpenDevStack provides a https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[Jenkins Shared Library] which offers three pipelines:

. A xref:jenkins-shared-library:component-pipeline.adoc[pipeline to build components], `odsComponentPipeline`. This pipeline allows to have a minimal `Jenkinsfile` in each repository by providing all language-agnostic build aspects. The goal is to duplicate as little as possible between repositories and have an easy way to ship updates to all projects. As a user, you will mostly interface with this pipeline.
. A xref:jenkins-shared-library:orchestration-pipeline.adoc[pipeline to orchestrate releases with multiple components], `odsOrchestrationPipeline`. It supports the orchestration of multiple repositories into a live application using the *Release Manager* quickstarter.
. A xref:jenkins-shared-library:quickstarter-pipeline.adoc[pipeline to provision quickstarters], `odsQuickstarterPipeline`. This pipeline is useful for quickstarter authors.

== Background

The implementation was originally based on https://www.relaxdiego.com/2018/02/jenkins-on-jenkins-shared-libraries.html. The scripted pipeline syntax was chosen because it is a better fit for a shared library. The declarative pipeline syntax is targeted for newcomers and/or simple pipelines (see https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#scripted-pipeline). If you try to use it e.g. within a Groovy class you'll end up with lots of `script` blocks.
