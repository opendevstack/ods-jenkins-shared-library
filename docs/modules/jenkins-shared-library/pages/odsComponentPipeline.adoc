== Pipeline Options

`odsComponentPipeline` can be customized by passing configuration options like this:
----
odsComponentPipeline(
  imageStreamTag: 'cd/jenkins-slave-golang:2.x',
  projectId: projectId,
  componentId: componentId,
  dockerDir: 'foo'
)
----

Available options are:

[cols="1,2"]
|===
| Property | Description

| image
| Container image to use for the Jenkins agent container. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| imageStreamTag
| Container image tag of an `ImageStream` in your OpenShift cluster to use for the Jenkins agent container. This value is not used when `podContainers` or `image` is set.

| alwaysPullImage
| Determine whether to always pull the container image before each build run. Defaults to `true`. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| resourceRequestMemory
| How much memory the container requests - defaults to 1Gi. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| resourceLimitMemory
| Maximum memory the container can use - defaults to 2Gi. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| resourceRequestCpu
| How much CPU the container requests - defaults to 10mi. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| resourceLimitCpu
| Maximum CPU the container can use - defaults to 300mi. This value is not used when `podContainers` is set.

| podLabel
| Pod label, set by default to a random label to avoid caching issues. Set to a stable label if you want to reuse pods across builds.

| podContainers
| Custom pod containers to use if the default, automatically configured container is not suitable for your use case (e.g. if you need multiple containers such as app and database). See <<_slave_customization,Slave customization>>.

| podVolumes

| podServiceAccount
| Serviceaccount to use when running the pod.

| notifyNotGreen
| Whether to send notifications if the build is not successful.

| branchToEnvironmentMapping
| Define which branches are deployed to which environments, see <<_git_workflow_branch_to_environment_mapping,Git Workflow / Branch to Environment Mapping>>

| autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping
| Define which environments are cloned from which source environments.

| projectId
| Project ID, e.g. `foo`.

| componentId
| Component ID, e.g. `be-auth-service`.

| environmentLimit
| Number of environments to allow.

| dockerDir
| The docker directory to use when building the image in openshift. Defaults to `docker`.

| sonarQubeBranch
| Deprecated in 3.x! Please use option `branch` on `odsComponentStageScanWithSonar`.

| failOnSnykScanVulnerabilities
| Deprecated in 3.x! Please use option `failOnVulnerabilities` on `odsComponentStageScanWithSnyk`.

== Pipeline Context

When you write custom stages inside the closure passed to `odsComponentPipeline`, you have access to the `context`, which is assembled for you on the master node. The `context` can be influenced by changing the config map passed to `odsComponentPipeline`, see <<_pipeline_options,Pipeline Options>>.

The `context` object contains the following properties:

[cols="1,2"]
|===

| jobName
| Value of JOB_NAME. It is the name of the project of the build.

| buildNumber
| Value of BUILD_NUMBER. The current build number, such as `153`.

|===

== Git Workflow / Branch to Environment Mapping

The shared library does not impose which Git workflow you use. Whether you use https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[git-flow], https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/[GitHub flow] or a custom workflow, it is possible to configure the pipeline according to your needs by configuring the pipeline option `branchToEnvironmentMapping`. The setting could look like this:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'master': 'prod',
  'develop': 'dev',
  'hotfix/': 'hotfix',
  '*': 'review'
]
----

There are three ways to reference branches:

* Fixed name (e.g. `master`)
* Prefix (ending with a slash, e.g. `hotfix/`)
* Any branch (`*`)

Matches are made top-to-bottom. For prefixes / any branch, a more specific environment might be selected if:

* the branch contains a ticket ID and a corresponding env exists in OpenShift. E.g. for mapping `"feature/": "dev"` and branch `feature/foo-123-bar`, the env `dev-123` is selected instead of `dev` if it exists.
* the branch name corresponds to an existing env in OpenShift. E.g. for mapping `"release/": "rel"` and branch `release/1.0.0`, the env `rel-1.0.0` is selected instead of `rel` if it exists.

=== Examples

If you use git-flow, the following config fits well:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'master': 'prod',
  'develop': 'dev',
  'release/': 'rel',
  'hotfix/': 'hotfix',
  '*': 'preview'
]
----

If you use GitHub Flow, the following config fits well:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'master': 'prod',
  '*': 'preview'
]
----

If you use a custom workflow, the config could look like this:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'production': 'prod',
  'master': 'dev',
  'staging': 'uat'
]
----

== Advanced

=== Slave customization

The slave used in the pipeline can be customized by adjusting the `image` (or `imageStreamTag` to
use. Further, `alwaysPullImage` (defaulting to `true`) can be used to
determine whether this image should be refreshed on each build.

Resource constraints of the container can be changed via `resourceRequestCpu`,
`resourceLimitCpu`, `resourceRequestMemory` and `resourceLimitMemory`.

The setting `podVolumes` allows to mount persistent volume claims to the pod
(the value is passed to the `podTemplate` call as `volumes`).

To completely control the container(s) within the pod, set `podContainers`
(which is passed to the `podTemplate` call as `containers`).

Configuring of a customized slave container in a `Jenkinsfile`:
----
odsComponentPipeline(
  projectId: projectId,
  podContainers: [
    containerTemplate(
      name: 'jnlp', // do not change, see https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin#constraints
      image: "${dockerRegistry}/foo-cd/jenkins-slave-custom",
      workingDir: '/tmp',
      resourceRequestCpu: '100m',
      resourceLimitCpu: '500m',
      resourceRequestMemory: '2Gi',
      resourceLimitMemory: '4Gi',
      alwaysPullImage: true,
      args: '${computer.jnlpmac} ${computer.name}'
    )
  ],
  ...
  ) { context ->
  stageBuild(context)
  ...
}
----
See the https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin#pod-and-container-template-configuration[kubernetes-plugin]
documentation for possible configuration.

=== Git LFS (Git Large File Storage extension)

If you are working with large files (e.g.: binary files, media files, files bigger than 5MB...),
you can follow the following steps:

* Check this HOWTO about https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-lfs[Git LFS]
* Track your large files in your local clone, as explained in previous step
* Enable Git LFS in your repository (if BitBucket: under repository's settings main page you can enable it)

*NOTE*: if already having a repository with large files and you want to migrate it to using git LFS:

[source,bash]
----
git lfs migrate
----

=== Automatically cloning environments on the fly

Caution! Cloning environments on-the-fly is an advanced feature and should only be used if you understand OpenShift well, as there are many moving parts and things can go wrong in multiple places.

Example:

----
autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping: [
  "hotfix": "prod",
  "review": "dev"
]
----

Instead of deploying multiple branches to the same environment, individual environments can be created on-the-fly. For example, the mapping `"*": "review"` deploys all branches to the `review` environment. To have one environment per branch / ticket ID, you can add the `review` environment to `autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping`, e.g. like this: `"review": "dev"`. This will create individual environments (named e.g. `review-123` or `review-foobar`), each cloned from the `dev` environment.

==== Examples

If you use git-flow, the following config fits well:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'master': 'prod',
  'develop': 'dev',
  'release/': 'rel',
  'hotfix/': 'hotfix',
  '*': 'preview'
]
autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping: [
  'rel': 'dev',
  'hotfix': 'prod',
  'preview': 'dev'
]
----

If you use GitHub Flow, the following config fits well:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'master': 'prod',
  '*': 'preview'
]
autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping: [
  'preview': 'prod'
]
----

If you use a custom workflow, the config could look like this:

----
branchToEnvironmentMapping: [
  'production': 'prod',
  'master': 'dev',
  'staging': 'uat'
]
autoCloneEnvironmentsFromSourceMapping: [
  'uat': 'prod'
]
----
