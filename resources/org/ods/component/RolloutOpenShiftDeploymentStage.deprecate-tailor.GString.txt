Detected Tailor deployment

Tailor is deprecated and might be removed in the future.

Please migrate to Helm based deployments.

See:

* https://helm.sh
* https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor/blob/master/README.md

********************************************************************************

> The main target of Tailor is OpenShift 3.11.
> Tailor also works against OpenShift 4,
> but it is recommended to transition to other tools,
> such as Helm or kustomize,
> which have become popular and work well against OpenShift 4.
