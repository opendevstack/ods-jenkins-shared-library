![](https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library/workflows/ODS%20Library%20Build/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Introduction

This library allows to have a minimal Jenkinsfile in each repository by providing all language-agnostic build aspects. The goal is to duplicate as little as possible between repositories and have an easy way to ship updates to all projects.
