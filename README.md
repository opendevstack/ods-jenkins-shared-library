# Jenkins Shared Library

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library)

## Introduction

This library allows to have a minimal Jenkinsfile in each repository by providing all language-agnostic build aspects. The goal is to duplicate as little as possible between repositories and have an easy way to ship updates to all projects.
