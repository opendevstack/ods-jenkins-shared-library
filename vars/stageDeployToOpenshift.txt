stageDeployToOpenshift deploys the service.

When no "openshift" folder is present, a deployment is just an update of the
container image.

However, when an "openshift" folder is present, this stage can fully control the
OpenShift resources for this service via code, e.g. it can deploy changes to
environment variables, or changing constraints etc. of the DeploymentConfig. It
does this by using Tailor (https://github.com/opendevstack/tailor) to sync the
"desired state" expressed in templates and parameters with the "current state"
found in OpenShift. Tailor automatically calculates the required changes and
applies them via JSON patchsets.

The "tailor" binary is pre-installed in the jenkins-slave-base image. The
behaviour of Tailor can be customized by adding a "Tailorfile" (or a more
specific, per-environment version of it such as "Tailorfile.foo-dev" and
"Tailorfile.foo-test").

The actual rollout of the deployment is watched, which also allows to monitor
the progress and fail the build if the rollout does not work.
