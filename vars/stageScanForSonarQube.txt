The "SonarQube Analysis" stage scans your source code and reports findings to
SonarQube. The configuration of the scan happens via the
"sonar-project.properties" file in the repository being built.

In debug mode, the sonar-scanner binary is started with the "-X" flag.

If no "sonar.projectVersion" is specified in "sonar-project.properties", it is
set to the shortened Git SHA.
